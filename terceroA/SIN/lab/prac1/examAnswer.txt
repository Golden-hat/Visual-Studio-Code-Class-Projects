1) Is this heuristic function admissible?

Yes, it is admissible, as it never provides an overestimation of the real cost for each state.
This is, in other words, that this heuristic defined as hC will not, for any state, provide a value
bigger than that of h* defined as the real cost for each state.

2) For state '781406235', compare and discuss the number of nodes generated, expanded and maximum 
stored, the solution cost and the running time of this heuristic function with Misplaced and Manhattan
heuristic functions.

Our heuristic yields... 

    -   Nodes generated: 495934                
    -   Nodes expanded: 181264
    -   Nodes stored: 181428

in comparison to...

Misplaced:

    -   Nodes generated: 25694
    -   Nodes expanded: 9324
    -   Nodes stored: 14871

Manhattan:

    -   Nodes generated: 706
    -   Nodes expanded: 266
    -   Nodes stored: 428

From this data we can extract that:
    -   Our heuristic is the least informed among all, in this order:
        Most informed-> Manhattan > Misplaced > New heuristic

        We know this because it generates the most nodes by far.

    -   Similarly, our New heurisitic will have the biggest spatial complexity,
        requiring the larges amount of nodes to be stored

    -   Every heurisitic is admissible, it's just that some are more informed
        than others and thus require less time to reach the optimal solution.
        (the new heurisitic takes a considerably higher amount of time).

    -   The solution cost remains the same for all heuristics. This proves that
        all of them are admissible (same, optimal solution).
