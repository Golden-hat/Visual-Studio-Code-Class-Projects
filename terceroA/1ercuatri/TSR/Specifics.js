/*
 * Javascript is an INTERPRETED LANGUAGE. THERE is NO COMPILER
 * as such, the program will stop only when errors are detected
 * at runtime.
 *
 * It is an ASYNCHRONOUS, SINGLE THREADED language ran by the Node.js
 * runtime environment. As such, there is no need for synchronization
 * mechanisms. It is an EVENT DRIVEN LANGUAGE. EVENTS are put into 
 * a QUEUE. Javascript uses lambda functions extensively, and it also
 * treats functions as first-class citizens.
 *
 * Main features of JSCRIPT:
 * 	- Imperative and structured.
 * 	- Functional programming.
 * 	- Object oriented programming.
 * 	- Related to java, python, perl, scheme...
 *
 * Its interpretation is embedded in web browsers
 * (as it was born in order to provide dynamical behaviour to webpages).
