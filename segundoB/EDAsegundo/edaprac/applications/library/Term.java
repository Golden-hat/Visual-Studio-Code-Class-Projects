/**
 * Term: Key class of a Map that represents a word or term of
 * the Analytical Index of a Digital Library.
 *
 * To override efficiently the equals and hashCode methods of Object,
 * each Term HAS A hashValue that stores the result of the FIRST
 * invocation of the hashCode method.
 * Thus, the hash value associated to a given Term...
 ** (a) is only computed once, regardless of the number of
 **     calls to hashCode;
 ** (b) can be used in the equals method of the class to ONLY check
 **     for equality if the hash values are equal.
 *
 * On top of that, to evaluate different hashCode implementations, each
 * Term HAS A hashCodeBase that stores the numerical base to use when
 * computing its hashValue.
